Project for software development
Using the IDE NetBeans

General Description:
Follow the instructions below.  This program provides a simplified example for selling tickets for three theaters within a movie house.  In order to better reflect Object-Oriented principle, much of the actual work takes place inside of the MovieHouse class.  This example will be hard-coded with three theaters in order to reduce complexity.  There is a sample of part of the output file  at the end of this problem.  A full sample is also available on line.

Challenges:
This was the first time actually using OOP for real program like records of purchases. Surprisingly the OOP part of the program was not the most challenging part. The challenging part was outputing the results in a file and also formatting a map of the theater seats. I know that displaying an output in a file is easy but in this program we were to make a method in a class that makes a reference to PrintWriter. Also this was the first time using the printf function in java for formatting. We also needed to use a double array with the primitve type boolean. This was a bit challenging at first but after a couple of research it was pretty easy to understand. Plus it was extremely useful when simulating a movie theater.

Things I Learned:
.PrintWriter with OOP
.Double arrray
.Formatting with printf
